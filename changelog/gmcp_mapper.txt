* marked moving entrance room for new 3rd class boss as volatile (thanks Erech for reporting it!)

2015-02-17 14:21:58
* re-added an accidentally deleted alias for mapper show database mods (thanks Cyrion for reporting this issue!)

2014-11-22 13:19:08
* added the mapper speedwalk next alias, to show the next speedwalk step (to help figure out in which direction to flee, etc.)
* added the mapper show database mods toggle, to control whether database updates will be shown on screen, or not
* tidied up the scripts, removed unused / obsolete code

2014-11-21
* fixed an issue in the lookup table (use mapper recreate lookup to fix your database!)
* added the mapper draw other floors toggle, to control whether floors above / below this one will be drawn in the miniwindow or not
* changed it to use the gmcphelper.lua module, to reduce the number of CallPlugin()s to the GMCP Handler
* change to mm_mapper..lua::
  + Added toggle_show_up_down() to let the user toggle the drawing of up/down exits via an alias
  Notice only the mapper.lua module needs to be updated to get both of the above changes

2014-07-24
* moved the "?" icon to the upper right corner of the miniwindow
* added code to resize the mapper miniwindow by dragging its bottom right corner (adapted from Fiendish's / Lasher's code for Aardwolf)
  Notice only the mapper.lua module needs to be updated to get both of the above changes

2014-07-22
* added code to show a background image (adapted from Fiendish's code for Aardwolf)
  + in case someone wants to use this feature, the image file needs to be RGB, 8 bits per channel, named mm_mapper_bg.png, and placed in MUSHclient/worlds.
  Notice only the mapper.lua module needs to be updated

2014-05-23 09:00:54
* fixed another issue with mapper purge aliases

2014-05-19 13:52:40
* fixed an issue with safewalk mode, in the mapper.lua module
  Notice only the mapper.lua module needs to be updated
  (if you're using the Plugins Updater, you only need to update aux files and reload the plugin)

2014-05-04 15:27:28
* fixed issues with mapper purge aliases

2014-04-24 19:01:37
* fixed issues with mapper bm and mapper findbm

2014-04-15 10:22:11
* fixed an issue that made new room flags fail to update

2014-04-10 03:16:29
* fixed an issue that made the PK flags for rooms not save when adding new rooms
* now deleting a room from the database also purges its user defined tags

2014-04/06 08:21:42
* made the latest changes (march-april) public for beta testing
  Remember for these features to work, you need to update the mapper.lua module.

2014-04-05
* added a yellow border for fear affect rooms
* added two new player_tags for rooms:: dt and no-speed
  + rooms tagged as dt (death_trap) are painted black, and are avoided on mapper goto speedwalks if safewalk is on;
  + rooms tagged as no-speed are always avoided on mapper goto speedwalks, regardless of safewalk.
  For these features to work, you need to update the mapper.lua module.
* moved look() checks to mazes_for_mapper
* added an alias, mapper purge wilds, to purge all rooms in a given plane, except for roads
* changed the hover message for rooms to include tags, and show terrain (+ terraininfo) in the same line

2014-03-15
* renamed the database to mm_mapper.db; so it no longer includes the server's URL as part of the file name (which means we'll have a unified database for both the live and the dev servers)
* restructured the rooms table in the mapper database, as follows:
  + added the flags column
  + removed the description column
  + removed the safe, lpk, npk, cpk columns (no longer needed, since those are all room flags now)
* moved user-set notes to a separate bookmarks table
* moved user-set tags (shop, trainer) to a separate player_tags table
* added an alias, mapper upgrade database, to convert old databases to the new format
* added compatibility scripts to support old databases for users who haven't upgraded to the new format
For these features to work, you need to update the mapper.lua module.

2014-01-18 15:27:23
* removed an extra link on the mapper where output that was preventing screen readers from accessing hyperlinks

2014-01-13 09:32:54
* made mapper find strip ANSI when showing results, if MushReader is detected (to fix an issue with JAWS and ANSI codes)

2014-01-12 10:35:53
* added the mapper safewalk toggle, to avoid PK on speedwalks.
  Note: this will only work for mapper goto speedwalks, and NOT for mapper path, or clicking on a room in the map, etc.
  Remember for this feature to work, you need to update the mapper.lua module.

2014-01-04 16:33:26
* changed the way it checks for the presence of other plugins

2014-01-04 07:13:22
* made it auto-purge its rooms cache when an area change is detected, to put a cap to its growth (it was only resetted on plugin install, so the amount of RAM used by MUSHclient could grow indefititely for this reason) - this change is experimental, we'll see if it doesn't slow us down too much

2014-01-03 11:58:40
* removed the help line stating that the game setting COMPASS was required to be ON, since this hasn't been true for quite a while (since GMCP room flags were added)
* if MushReader is detected, it will also auto-toggle show_database_mods off, to reduce spam
* added a 3 second delay to its initial detection of MushReader, to give that plugin time to load
* made it check on startup whether MushReader is present - if it is, then this mapper will auto-hide its miniwindow

2013-12-31 05:41:19
* added the alias mapper adjacent - it should help answer questions like "on what street is X?"

2013-12-30 21:48:49
* made map_goto() check if the destination room is mapped before it tries to find a path to it

2013-12-15 09:10:39
* it no longer re-calculuates speedwalks after auto-openning a door
* auto-open doors should no longer fail when the first thing to do in a speedwalk is auto-open a door
* moved auto-open doors to the mapper.lua module
  Remember for this feature to work, you need to update the mapper.lua module.

2013-12-08 16:57:46
* added an alias to toggle road-exits on or off (mapper show unmapped exits [on|off] - off by default)

2013-11-09 11:08:20
* fixed an issue with persistent visible state reverting to off
* added support for extended-prompt off

2013-11-06 08:31:39
* made the "is the miniwindow visible?" state persistent (toggeable using mapper show and mapper hide, as usual)

2013-10-24 01:33:45
* added an alias to toggle road-exits on or off (mapper show road exits [on|off] - off by default)
* added a feature that shows on-road exits, below visible exits (hopefully to help sight-impaired playrs follow roads in the wilds)

2013-10-20 08:45:39
* made the mapper map wilds and mapper map mazes aliases work with or without a parameter (without it, they work as toggles)
* renamed the mapper show terrain alias to mapper color terrain (tio make what it does more obvious)
* made the auto_open, color_terrain, do_map_mazes, do_map_wilds, show_flags and show_numbers settings persistent, via SaveState()

2013-10-14 16:11:50
* fixed some issues related to mazes

2013-09-19 13:11:40
* fixed an issue with mapper export / import that was making them fail when the room had no flags

2013-08-30 20:29:11
* added room #12258 (A Frozen Passage in Rune Forest) as a volatile room

2013-08-27 11:59:27
* added room #12242 (A Dark Alcove in Rune Forest) as a volatile room

2013-08-26 09:15:55
* added a variable to keep track of whether the user prefers to show the mapper miniwindow, or not - this fixes an issue with switch_maps re-showing the mapper's miniwindow while not in the wilds, after the user had hidden it manually

2013-08-24 12:55:26
* fixed more issues related to mazes

* added a function, get_room_areas(), to interface with the quests_helper plugin.

2013-07-24 11:33:30
* fixed an issue where mapper purge - it wasn't purging bookmarks / notes for certain areas (eg, A Dizzying Array)

2013-07-06 08:34:53
* added a toggle to allow mapping the wilds (mapper map wilds)
  Note: the more rooms you add to the map, the slower it will be to search for stuff, so use this option wisely.

2013-07-05 13:20:53
* added an alias to purge an entire area from the database (mapper purge area)

2013-06-22 10:47:05
* added a toggle for the auto-open doors feature (mapper auto-open)

2013-05-28 10:46:36
* fixed an issue with auto-open doors
  (it wouldn't resume a speedwalk if the destination was farther than depth rooms away)

2013-05-15 11:01:23
* fixed a bugged call to the function that logs moving rooms to events_mini

2013-05-12 03:50:28
* added mapper export rooms and mapper export area
* when entering a room that links to a moving room, it should add a line to events_mini (if it's intalled)
* added mapper reset defaults

2013-04-21 00:24:24
* removed spook_check trigger that didn't belong here :x

2013-04-17 11:30:29
* fixed a glitch with auto-open when the first step on a mapper speedwalk was blocked by a door
* made it broadcast when a mapper speedwalk is waiting for the user to enter a portal
  Remember for these features to work, you need to update the mapper.lua module.

2013-04-06 09:01:12
* auto-open doors should now only attempt to open the direction we need to go
  Note: for this feature to work, you need to update the mapper.lua module.

2013-02-22 22:10:34
* added search by notes / bookmarks

2013-01-26 11:13:19

  Note: for this feature to work, you need to update the mapper.lua module.

2013-01-05 12:14:22
* cosmetic bug fix

2012-11-15 11:00:37
* made it not update the anti-magic flag for Tellerium

2012-10-23 12:05:04
