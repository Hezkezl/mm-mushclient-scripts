* changed the way it detects the end of a combat round
  (before, it counted the different types of attacks + defenses used during the round, and checked that the total was > 1;
  now it counts the total number of attacks + defenses used during the round, and checks that the total is > 2)

* changed the way it checks for the presence of other plugins

* if MushReader is present, and play_sounds is also present, it will now play the ping.mp3 sound when it detects the end of a combat round

* made the short_names, show_bparts, show_avg_dmg and check_victimhp settings persistent, via SaveState()

* fixed char_name detection to include NPCs that have numbers in their names (eg, an automaton behemoth, Crusher MK1)

2013-04-24 08:34:56
* changed colors used for third-party lines (someone else vs someone else), when not in brief mode

* fixed some issues with toggles working backwards or not at all

* added body parts hit counters, and made them toggeable
* reworked average damage calculations, and made them toggeable
* added a more verbose mode for names (on beta stage, should work for combat mode normal and verbose, and made it toggeable
* added a toggle to auto-send check victimhp on end-of-round
* reworked end-of-round detection (beta)
* it no longer keeps track of the 'target', so it can be used in form vs form situations (this works better if short_names is turned off)
* made it show totals on the next empty line after damage / defenses, which eliminates the need for an "am I in combat?" check
