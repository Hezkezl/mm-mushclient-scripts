* changed the way it detects return to world focus - it now uses OnPluginGetFocus(), which reacts immediately

2013-12-08 11:38:08	
* changed the way it adds captures to notepads - it will now work as follows:
  - when the world window has focus, it adds stuff to captures normally;
  - when the world window doesn't have focus, it holds the new captured lines in a buffer, to be added later when the world window regains focus.
(This is an experiment, to prevent the notepads from constantly skipping to the last line whenever new text is added. It should for example make things easier for people using screen readers.)
