* changed it to use the gmcphelper.lua module, to reduce the number of CallPlugin()s to the GMCP Handler

* changed the way it checks for the presence of other plugins

* changed the way it calls IMap_GMCP and MM_GMCP_Mapper. to show / hide their respective miniwindows, from using aliases to using CallPlugin() - this fixes an issue with switch_maps re-showing those windows, even when you'd preferred to keep them hidden
Note this change requires you to update both IMap_GMCP and MM_GMCP_Mapper.
