* fixed yet another missing check vs nil issue, when using the aucverb option, where if you logged in after an auction had started, it crashed horribly (thanks Alelacan for reporting this issue, and even pinpointing what was causing it! ^_^)

2014-11-09 18:28:57
* changed it to use the gmcphelper.lua module, to reduce the number of CallPlugin()s to the GMCP Handler

2014-11-03 18:30:34
* fixed an issue with content filters

2014-11-03 07:59:40

2014-11-02 06:42:06
* fixed unfiltered relays (for capture2notepads, etc.) to broadcast all relay channels, whether they are chosen to be captured or not

2014-10-31 22:13:12
* got rid of pseudo-channels, so it's now 1 channel type per game channel type (mostly)
  pseudo-channels were split as follows:
  + private: notify, page, tell
  + public: archon, shout, talk, yell
* got rid of "special relays"
  there is now only 1 list of relays to be captured, which can be edited using the aliases capture relay <channel> and uncapture relay <channel>

2014-10-24 21:06:14

2013-11-18 08:28:13
* added 1 extra parameter to plain text broadcasts, to lessen the spam
* changed the table separator for broadcasts to something other than ";", to fix an issue with messages including ";" - using a non-standard ASCII char now, so let me know if you have any issues

2013-11-05 20:39:50

2013-04-20 19:53:28
* fixed an issue with the 'say' capture triggers

2013-04-20 09:37:45
* made it broadcast whenever it captures text
  (this reverts the way it used to work - now capture2mini will watch for this plugin's broadcasts instead)

  Two types of broadcasts:
  + msg = 1 for filtered broadcasts, to be used by capture2mini and similar plugins
  + msg = 2 for unfiltered broadcasts, to be used by capture2notepads and similar plugins.
