* made it public for beta testing (please report bugs to Ruthgul.)

2014-07-23
* started based on the Main_Layout plugin for Aardwolf by Fiendish and Lasher
* moved all miniwindow related code into the world_miniwindow.lua module, for easier maintenance
* renamed the background and logo images to bg.png and mm_logo.png, which must be located in MUSHclient/worlds (in case someone wants to use them, they need to be RGB, 8 bits per channel)
* replaced the resizer code with the one from generic_miniwindow.lua for a more consistent look (code by Lasher, Enelya)
* Notice the world_miniwindow.lua module needs to be present
