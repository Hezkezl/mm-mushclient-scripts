* reworked name detection & storage into separate plugins
  If you're updating this plugin, please notice it now needs other 3 plugins to work, as explained in Requirements.

  (eg, if you added 'levitation' to the list of wanted affects, and you'r'e affected by 'float', it won't list levitation as missing)
