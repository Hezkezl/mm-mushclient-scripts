* changed the way it checks for the presence of other plugins

* added a 3 second delay to its initial detection of MushReader, to give that plugin time to load

2014-01-01 08:35:48
* if MushReader is present, and play_sounds is also present, it will now play the tick.mp3 sound 3 seconds before a tick, once it's synchronized

* added a tick mute alias, that will toggle SAPI tick announcements on / off
* [deleted] made it SAPI say "incoming tick" 3 seconds before a tick happens, if MushReader is present
* it will not show the miniwindow if it detects MushReader is present

2013-08-17 07:52:14

2013-07-05 10:34:21
* fixed char_name detection to include NPCs that have numbers in their names (eg, an automaton behemoth, Crusher MK1)

2013-02-09 16:35:16
* made it warn more frequently when it might be unsync'd

* made it not auto-resync anymore - when it unsync's, type tick sync to force resyncs
* restored the tick sync alias, to force a resync without needing to reinstall the plugin
* remade the tick timer

2013-01-11 11:29:17
