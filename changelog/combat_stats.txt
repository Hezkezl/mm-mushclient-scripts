2014-04-11 09:02:04

2013-04-04 19:20:51

2013-01-18 10:27:53
* fixed druid spell names issue - eg, it used "air" instead of "air invocation" and "air evocation"
 (please reset counters after you update, the old data for these spells is wrong)

2012-11-07 11:34:24
* changed the way it detects the actual beginning of spellcasting
  (this should fix an issue with a spell being wrongly identified, when a second spell was cast before the first one ended casting)

2012-11-06 21:14:11
* fixed issues with music and weapons detection, hopefully (thanks Eljay!)

2012-11-06 13:23:02

  If you wanna test this feature, please make aliases for your spells as explained in Requirements.

2012-11-04 03:16:08

  (this will only reset the hits / misses counters, not the usage one)

2012-11-03 20:02:17
* added defensive skills - only usage betters are counted for them
  (because they lack a failure string)
* made it not report after combat info when stats are empty.

2912-11-03 09:30:43
* added usage counters until usage betters happen, as requested by Riya
  (these are not resetted by level / multi-class betters)
