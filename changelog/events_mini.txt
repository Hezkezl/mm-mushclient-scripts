* moved all the miniwindow code to a module file (generic_miniwindow.lua), to make these plugins easier to maintain
Notice if you already have a previous version of this plugin, and you try to update it using Plugins Updater, it won't work. You'll need to download and install it manually, as explained above. (This is because previous versions don't "know" about the module.) Once you install this new version, Plugins Updater will let you update it ok.
