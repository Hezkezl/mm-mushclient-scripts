To update plugins_updater_v2, and enable it to work with this github repo:

1. download the file:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mu3r73/mm-mushclient-scripts/master/src/plugins_updater_v2.xml

... place it in the folder:
MUSHclient/world/plugins/MM/

2. in MUSHclient:

a) open the plugins window (by pressing ctrl + shift + p)

b) locate and select plugins_updater_v2

c) click "ReInstall"


Once you've done this, it should auto-scan your local MUSHclient plugins, and offer you the option to update them.

To do so, after it's done scanning, type:
update plugins lastlist
